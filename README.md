# Remove Notion ID

If you ever exported pages from Notion into Markdown files, you will notice that the file's name has a UID at the end; something like `Page Title 6382b539d0f646499dd55b22aa7c8afb`. If you export many pages and many are subpages of others, it becomes a problem to edit all pages' names and contents by hand, so here are Python and Bash scripts to do the same thing. Cheers!
